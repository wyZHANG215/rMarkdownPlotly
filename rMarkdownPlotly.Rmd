## Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

```{r explore_plotly}
# Plot the cars vs the mpg data from the mtcars data.
plot_ly(x = 1:32, y = mtcars$mpg , type = "bar")
```
